		<h1>Our Services</h1>
		<p>We are pawn brokers and you can deposit any object with us as security for money lent. We offer buying and selling/pawing of antique and unique products along with the following services:</p>
    
   
    <p>
      <b>ART: </b>Generally we are only buying original or limited edition works, pieces numbered xx/1000 for example. If this is an item you can bring to the shop, before visiting us it is best to email abcd@gmail.com pictures and any info you have on the piece. They will let you know if we are interested.<br><br>
      <b>COINS: </b>We buy all third party graded and encapsulated coins, as well as any silver, gold, platinum or palladium coins & bullion. If coins are not graded we will buy them for their precious metal value only.<br> <br>     
      <b>AUTOGRAPHED ITEMS: </b>We require a Certificate or Letter of Authenticity on all signed Items! We prefer the COA to be issued by one of the following companies, Beckett Authentication, JSA, PSA/DNA or Steiner. If you do not have a COA you can go to any of these companies websites to get your item evaluated via mail submission or in person events. Steve Grad autograph expert from “Pawn Stars” also authenticates in our store about every other month. Check “News & Press” above or our Facebook for the next dates. <br><br>     
      <b>FURNITURE: </b>We do not buy furniture pieces even if they are antiques as we do not have the floor space. <br><br>
      <b>RECORDS: </b>We do not buy LP's or CD's. <br><br>
      <b>SPORTS CARDS: </b>We are only in the market to buy graded cards from the 60's or older.<br><br>
      <b>BEANIE BABIES: </b>We do not buy any Beanie Babies, even rare or limited edition ones.<br><br>
      <b>SUNGLASSES, SHOES, DESIGNER BAGS: </b>We do not buy these.<br><br>
      <b>FIREARMS: </b>Due to Federal Regulations, we can only buy weapons manufactured in 1898 or before.<br><br>
      <b>APPLE PRODUCTS/ELECTRONICS: </b>Be ready to remove any AppleID’s or other passwords at the counter. All electronics must be fully logged out of any accounts and not password protected.<br><br>
      <b>COMIC BOOKS & TRADING CARD GAMES: </b>We are in the market for graded comic books and graded trading cards (ex: Yugioh, Pokemon, Magic). We are not currently buying non graded cards/comics, visit CGC for more information on getting your items graded. All items must be brought to the shop for purchase but if you want to check if we would be interested you can email photos to jesus.herrera@gspawn.com, please note this email is only for submitting graded cards and comics that you can personally bring to Las Vegas to sell!<br><br></p>
