        <h1 id="loan-procedure">Loan Procedures</h1>
        <p>You bring in something you own and give it to the pawnbroker as collateral for a loan (this act is called pawning). The pawnbroker loans you money against that collateral. When you repay the loan plus the interest, you get your collateral back. If you don't repay the loan, the pawnbroker keeps the collateral.</p>
        <h3 >Just looking for a loan? We are always happy to pawn your items here is how it works...</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>After you bring your item in we settle on a amount that we will loan you today for your item. The Loan contract will be written for 90 days and you will be paid in cash.</li>
          <li>We Charge 13% every 30 days the loan is outstanding. Any period from 1-30 days will still be charged the same amount. (Active Duty Military members only pay 3%)        </li>
          <li>A one time $5 Fee will also be charged with every new loan, and a $4 lost ticket fee will be assessed if you require a new pawn ticket.        </li>
          <li>If you do not come back to claim your item before the 90 day loan period expires you can still pick up your item if we still have it in inventory. You will simply pay the additional interest and a $10 late fee.        </li>
          <li>Only Cash, Money Order or Cashiers Check is accepted as payment on a loan.        </li>
          <li>If you are not in town we can arrange payment via mail, just mail us a copy of your ticket, ID and a cashiers check or money order. A new ticket will be mailed back to you.</li>
          <li>We can also mail your item back after a mail payment, just call us first so we can give you the shipping total to add to your final payment.        </li>
          <li>Pick up your items 24/7 at our night window, just call us during normal business hours 9-5 so we can have your item pulled from the safe and available after hours.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Any Questions? Email abcd@gmail.com or give us a call at 7015XXXXX1. The line can get very busy so we apologize if we miss your call please try again in 10-15 minutes.</p>
